# Password_Generator

This development was designed to help users to create high level of security passwords. 

The system will prompt you with a series of options that you can include in the generation of the password. You can choose if you want to include an uppercase character, a number, or/and a special character. 

The system has the capability of creating passwords from 8 up to 128 characters. 

I hope you find this development useful for your new account setups.
